This repo contains 3 examples:
1) Running Impact-T on the FACET-II lattice
2) Running a parameter scan on the same setup using Xopt
3) Pulling data from the parameter scan and comparing to actual data taken on the machine

Each folder has a standalone example, and for the third example, files can be loaded from the links in the repo, assuming SLAC s3df access.

Make sure to install the packages listed at the top of each notebook
